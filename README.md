"# EZtune" 

Version 3.0.0 was updated to include options for tuning using AUC for 
classification models and mean absolute error (MAE) for regression 
models. 

The function eztune_cv returns both the classification accuracy and 
AUC for classification models. It returns both MSE and MAE for 
regression models.
